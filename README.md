# Cursed Energy

**Cursed Energy** is a custom Foundry VTT module inspired by *Jujutsu Kaisen*.  
It replaces the default spell slot system with a unified pool of **Cursed Energy (CE)**.  
All spellcasting classes now spend CE instead of slots, with automatic scaling by level and caster type.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Unified CE Pool**  
  Spell slots are no longer used ‚Äî all casters draw from a single pool of Cursed Energy.  
  CE maximum is calculated automatically based on level and caster category (full, half, third, misc).

- **Automatic Costs**  
  Spells consume CE depending on level (configurable curve).  
  Rituals and cantrips can have multipliers or fixed costs.

- **UI Integration**  
  - Compact **badge** in the actor header with CE value/max, +/‚Äì buttons, and category override.  
  - Large **bar** under Hit Dice/Resources showing CE visually.  
  - Tooltips on spells show CE cost, and unaffordable spells appear dimmed.

- **Migration Tool**  
  One-click button to populate CE on all actors, hide slots, and enforce CE usage.

- **Rest Recovery**  
  - **Long Rest**: fully restores CE.  
  - **Short Rest**: restores a fraction (25% default, 50% for Warlock-like casters).

- **Customization**  
  - JSON configs for cost curves and class‚Üícategory mapping.  
  - Per-spell CE cost overrides.  
  - Actor-specific caster category overrides.  
  - `/ea` chat command (`+5`, `-10%`, `set 30`, `max`, `recalc`, etc.).

- **Playground (Simulator)**  
  Test CE scaling by level and category, preview cost curves, and apply results to actors.
